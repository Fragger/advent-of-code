# Advent of Code 2025

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

In Python 3.14

Run from solution directory (after grabbing input into input directory):
```
python [day].py
```
Each solution should output two lines, the first being the answer for Part One and the second the answer for Part Two

Solutions also take an optional argument for an input file to use,\
i.e. if you wanted to run it with the example `python [day].py ../input/[day]-example`
